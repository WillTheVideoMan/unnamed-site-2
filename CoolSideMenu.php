<p style = "width:25%;float:left;">TLA was formed in September 2008, after Tonicha had been successfully teaching professionally trained actors. The academy started with only eight children and has since grown from strength to strength.

Opportunities in the academy include auditioning to become part of the prestigious Show Team which works professionally throughout the year and TLA Theatre which works on classical plays.

Situated between Harrogate, Wetherby, Leeds and York, TLA is the professional training platform to performing arts in the North. Classes in Drama, Dance, Singing and Music are the key factors to what makes the school so incredibly popular amongst casting directors, visiting TV and Theatre directors and established tutors. LAMDA is also available for those wishing to take their exams.

Our actors regularly work in Theatre, Television, Commercials and Short Films with the agency forming good relations with Casting Directors and Directors nationwide.

In 2011, Tonicha streamlined the agency and took inspiration from the American style of representation, favouring Boutique Agencies and Personal Management. This allows Tonicha to build closer working relationships with her clients, seeing that everyone works to achieve their own professional goals.

With a packed calendar for the year of shows, work opportunities, teacher training and workshops there is no need to look anywhere else for your training. Children, adults, professional actors and trainees are seeking Tonicha’s unique style of training to get their careers on the right path from the start!</p>
